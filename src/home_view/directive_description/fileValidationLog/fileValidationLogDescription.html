            <code><<span>file-tabs</span>></code> is a component that is used for the display of errors, warnings and other such details about uploaded files that need to be shown to the user before they proceed further.
        </p>
        <p>
            To start you would need to specify the data attribute. <br>
            The file name is the key to an object. Each object will have arrays of the details that the users wishes to display. Here we are using only two details warnings and errors but the user can display summary as well. It will also be in the same manner.
            
                <pre>
sample_data = {
    "file 1": {
        "errors": ["error1", "error2", "error3", "error4", "error5", "error6"],
        "warnings": []
    },
    "file 2": {
        "errors": ["error1", "error2", "error3", "error4"],
        "warnings": ["warning1", "warning2", "warning3", "warning4"]
    },
}
</pre>
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            Note:- All the objects in the JSON object should contain all the arrays. If the array does not have any entries associated to it for that particular file, then the list can be left empty, but it needs to be defined. For references please have a look at the above example.
